AI SalesFlow: User Story Based Project Understanding
This section describes the full project from the viewpoint of real users.
Each story explains what they want, why they want it, and how the system should behave for them.

1. As a founder of a service based software company
   I want a simple platform that captures every lead from my website so I never miss anyone who wants to talk to us.
   I want the system to instantly understand what the lead needs and send them a polite email.
   I want to see all the new leads in a clean dashboard without jumping between email inboxes.
   I want the AI to talk in my company’s voice so the tone feels personal and professional.
   I want to reduce manual work so my team does not spend hours replying to basic inquiries every day.

2. As a sales manager
   I want all incoming leads to appear in one place, sorted by newest first.
   I want to click on any lead and see a short AI generated summary of what they need because reading long messages takes too much time.
   I want the AI to extract useful information like budget, timeline, and service type so I understand the strength of each lead.
   I want to reply to emails directly from the platform so my workflow stays simple.
   I want the AI to help me draft responses when I am busy or unsure of wording.
   I want to update the lead status easily from open to in progress or closed.

3. As an SDR (sales development rep)
   I want to see the messages from leads in a single inbox so I do not have to check Gmail again and again.
   I want each message to show me the history of the conversation.
   I want the reply box to have an “AI suggest reply” button so I can save time and avoid typing long answers.
   I want the system to tell me which leads are hot or warm so I know where to focus my attention.

4. As a website visitor
   I want a simple chat bubble where I can quickly tell the company what I need.
   I want the form to be short, fast to fill, and friendly.
   I want to know immediately that the company received my message.
   I want a confirmation email so I know someone will contact me soon.

5. As a tenant admin
   I want to configure my AI agent without needing technical knowledge.
   I want to tell the AI about my services and my company.
   I want to set the tone of voice so the AI replies match my brand.
   I want to test the AI right inside the settings page.
   I want to invite my team members and manage who has access.
   I want to update my company name, logo, and time zone easily.

6. As a super admin (Brilworks internal)
   I want to see all tenant accounts in a single list.
   I want to view basic usage like number of leads and messages sent.
   I want the ability to disable or enable tenants if needed.
   I want to ensure the system works smoothly across all tenants.

Core Behaviors Expected by Users
Lead Capture
When a visitor fills the chat widget or a contact form, a lead is created instantly.

The system should enrich, summarize, and qualify the lead without human involvement.

A polite auto reply email should be sent immediately.

AI Understanding
The AI should understand messages in natural language.

It should extract important fields like service type, budget, and timeline.

It should generate a short summary that saves time for the sales team.

Inbox
All emails should appear as conversations inside the platform.

Users should be able to reply directly.

AI should assist with drafting replies when asked.

Conversations should show a clean history of messages.

Dashboard
Users expect quick snapshots of new leads, open leads, and auto replies.

Basic charts help them understand activity at a glance.

AI Agent Configuration
Users want a simple way to describe their company and services.

They want to provide FAQs that the AI can use.

They want to test the AI instantly to see how it replies.

Tenant Settings
Users want to manage their profile and their team.

They want to change their company details easily.

They want simple email configuration.

Reliability and Simplicity
Every user expects the system to be:
Fast

Clean

Easy to use

Not overloaded with features

Consistent from screen to screen

The MVP is meant to provide reliability first, then extra power in later phases.

The Complete Vision in User Story Tone
As a company owner, I want a system that treats every lead with respect, responds instantly, and helps my team look professional.
As a sales manager, I want AI to reduce my workload so I can focus on closing deals rather than initial conversations.
As an SDR, I want clean tools, smart AI assistance, and no missed messages.
As a website visitor, I want quick answers and trust that the company will respond.
As the product owner at Brilworks, I want a simple, stable, scalable MVP that uses free tier services so the cost stays minimal while we prove the value of the product.
This MVP lays the foundation for a future platform that will automate almost the entire early sales cycle across email, WhatsApp, voice, and CRM.
